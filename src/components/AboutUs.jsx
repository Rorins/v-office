           <h2 className="color_secondary">We happen to be two married developers.</h2> 
           <p className="aurora"><span className="color_secondary">Aurora</span>:I discovered the magical world of coding in my mid twenties,
            I came across an interesting game engine that used Python and from there I was addicted.
            I never considered it a job, I just had so much fun creating games until I came across the incredible world of web development.
            Decided to pursue a coding bootcamp to get my skills recognized and graduated as a Full-stack developer.
            <span>Highly focused on the Front-end with HTML, CSS/SASS,Javascript, React/Next/Gatsby, Vue/Nuxt and PHP, firebase for Back-end.</span>
            To me technology and coding are an incredible art that can not only change the world we live in but it's also a tool that can make any idea and dream come to life.

            Worked as a Data analyst and sys admin support, I decided to switch to coding.
            I prefer the creative and active role of web development and wish to grow in this career.
            After a coding bootcamp as a Full-stack developer, I specialized myself in <span>HTML,CSS, React/Next and Java on the Back-end.</span>
